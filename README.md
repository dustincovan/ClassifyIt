# ClassifyIt
A demo of an educational game I created at the request of a 2nd-grade science teacher to teach his students about the classification of vertebrates. The current design is temporary, because the final design will include images created by the students. I used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Javascript / JQuery to create this app.
